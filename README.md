The website I recreated was a portfoli website. https://www.erenaygun.com/#home

It was a portfolio/resume website for this other developer, and I really enjoyed how it functioned and wasnt too crazy.

The boostrap components I used were:

Navbar: Used bootstraps nav bar to create a stylish and responsive navigation system.
Columns: I used bootstraps grid system for pos of items within my page.
Cards: I used bootstraps cards to display some of my past projects.
Styling: I used bootstraps built in color designs to color, and match everything.
Table: I used a lot of different bootstrap table classes.
Form: made a basic contact form.


-- JS FUNCTIONS --
Dark or light them: I would create a button to toggle this on and off witht the class "dark-theme"

Check for saved theme: would be integrated by default if called into the project

Back to top buttons: I would put a button on to the page so once clicked it bring you to the top. it only appears once it's so far down

Greeting Text: I would add the text into my greeting message at the top and give it a span tag with the id of timeOfDayGreeting
